# Introduction

This is how Fejix works:

1. You write a few Fjml files that describe your UI.
2. You write your main code that interacts with UI.
3. You compile Fjml and your main code.
4. You get a working GUI app.

This tutorial will teach you Fjml, how it works, how to write, compile and use it.

This is not a tutorial about how to program nor about how to use terminals, Git, Cargo etc.
