# Fejix website

Creating websites is tedious...

I decided that this website will only consist of one front page that links to news/docs/tutorials.

To build tutorials (Markdown -> HTML):

```sh
npm run build-books
```

Some things you will find in this repo are out of date and irrelevant.
You may ignore them.
