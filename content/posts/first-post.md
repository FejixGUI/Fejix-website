# Hello world!

I have been developing the idea of Fejix since August 2021 and finally decided that there are far too many ideas to store them in a handful of GitHub repos. Everything should be kept in one place and look nice.

I've recently created a GitHub organisation called [FejixGUI](https://github.com/FejixGUI) to dump everything dedicated to Fejix there. And all links at this site will bring you there. I used the name 'FejixGUI' because 'Fejix' was already taken. Damn it! How would anybody come up with exactly the same name?

I originally wanted to name my project after a fruit. I chose feijoa :melon: because it sounds beatifully and I like those letters F and J standing next to each other. However, it turned out 'feijoa' is hard as hell to type. Really. Let's just type it a few times: feijox, fiejoz, fiejao. Moreover, 'feijoa' is a somewhat too long.

English people seem to me a little bit crazy about the letter X - Space**X**, Mac OS **X**, Iphone **X**, **X**ero**x**, **X**box. So, why not being crazy about it, too? If we add X to the end, we get something like 'feijix'. And then simplified for easier typing: fejix.

As a file extention, '.fejix' is shortened to '.fj'.

I don't know why you need to know this, but letters F and J are the letters that have bumps on keyboards for touch typing. Coincidence?

By the way, happy 8th of March!
